namespace -> class -> method

namespcase ==> used for organization
class ==> has member(such as method)
method ==> contains a block of code

blocks in C# are code between curly brackets

variable ==> store some value

create a variable
    use var if we don't know what the data type is
    use specific data type if we know what the data type is

use rReadLine to make one line user input

example of string interpelation
    Console.WriteLine($"You typed: {input}");

identifier ==> what we call variable

expression ==> evealuates to a value

null ==> nothing

if we assign float, after the number use 'F'
if we assign decimal, after the number use 'M'
